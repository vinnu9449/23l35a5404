# AffordMed Frontend Logging Test
This project was built as part of the **AffordMed placement task**, where I chose the **Frontend track**.  
The application demonstrates a simple **logging interface** where users can send logs by providing an **Auth Token, Message, Log Level, and Package**.  
It is built with **React + Vite** and styled using **Material UI**.


## 🚀 Features
 Input fields for **Auth Token** and **Message**
 Dropdown selection for **Log Level** (Info, Warning, Error, etc.)
 Dropdown selection for **Package** (e.g., Style, UI, API)
 Real-time success notification on log submission
 Built with **React (Vite)** for fast development and optimized performance
